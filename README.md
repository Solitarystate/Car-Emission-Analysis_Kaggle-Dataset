# Car-Emission-Analysis_Kaggle-Dataset
Data sourced from the UK government, and used in the Car Registration API http://www.regcheck.org.uk - Correct as of August 2017.

The data contains information about different car manufacturers, their models. Emission type and the amount of emission per toxic gas type. 
This analysis tries to extend to model the data in such a way that we convert the emissions into textual values and standardize it by calling the car 'Green Car', 'Acceptable Emission Level', 'Not Acceptable Emission Level' and 'Dangerous Emission Level' based on the total amount of emission it does of all given toxic gases.

Then we try to model it and classify given a car and its additional information what category does it fall into.
